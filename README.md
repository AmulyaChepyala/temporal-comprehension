# temporal-comprehension
This project was done as part of my academic course structure. 
The data is split into train data and test data. We try to understand the data with respect to time and commonsense which is termed as Temporal Compresension. 
We used two different models, 1. TF-IDF Model , 2. BERT Model. 
BERT model gives better results in the case of this data.
